# Getting started with Effra

This guide explains the full invoice journey in Effra — from raising invoices in your PMS to getting paid — and highlights when (if ever) you need to take action.

---

## Overview

Effra sits between your **practice management system (PMS)** and **insurers/patients**, automating submission, follow-ups, and reconciliation so you get paid faster with less admin.

<Callout type="info">
Most invoices require **no manual action**. Effra will only ask for your input when something is missing or needs a decision.
</Callout>

---

## 1. Raise invoices in your PMS

Raise invoices in your practice management system as you normally would.

- Effra automatically imports new invoices
- Import typically happens within **15 minutes**
- No additional steps required in Effra at this stage

---

## 2. Resolve invoices that need input

If an invoice is missing information or needs clarification, it will move into the **Action required** state.

- Each invoice includes a **note explaining exactly what’s needed**
- You can filter to see only these invoices

<Callout type="tip">
Use this link to view all invoices currently needing attention:  
[View invoices in “Action required”](https://app.effra.io/invoices?query%5Bstatus%5D=&query%5Bstatus%5D=Action+Required&query%5Bdate_field%5D=Invoice+Date&query%5Bdate_from%5D=&query%5Bdate_to%5D=&query%5Bprovider_id%5D=&query%5Binsurer%5D=&query%5Binvoice_number%5D=)
</Callout>

Once the required information is provided, Effra will handle the rest.

---

## 3. Invoice submission to insurers

When an invoice is ready:

- It moves into the **Submitted** state
- Effra submits it to the insurer
- The invoice remains submitted while the insurer adjudicates it

No action is needed from you during this stage.

---

## 4. Remittance statement processing

Effra automatically processes remittance statements, as long as we can access them. The setup depends on the insurer and delivery method.

## 5. Insurer shortfalls (not patient responsibility)

If an insurer underpays an invoice for reasons such as:

- The insurer believes the charge is too high
- A coding or tariff dispute

…the invoice will move into **Insurer shortfall**.

### What to do

- Review the invoice and insurer decision
- Decide whether you want to resubmit or accept the shortfall
- If you want Effra to resubmit, **leave a comment on the invoice** confirming this

Effra will handle the resubmission process for you.

---

## 6. Patient-responsible shortfalls

When a shortfall is the **patient’s responsibility**, Effra handles patient billing on your behalf.

### How patient billing works

- Effra sends the patient an invoice **due in 5 days**
- The invoice:
  - Uses **your branding**
  - Routes any patient replies **directly to you**
- You stay fully in control of the patient experience

### Payment collection

- **Card on file**: payment is collected automatically after 5 days
- **Unpaid after 28 days**: Effra emails you so you can decide how to escalate

<Callout type="info">
Effra never communicates clinically or makes discretionary decisions with patients — you remain the point of contact.
</Callout>
