title: "Bank reconciliation"
---

You can optionally connect your bank account to Effra so we can reconcile insurer payments all the way through to your bank account.

We will send you specific instructions for how to connect your bank account.

The benefits of connecting your bank account are:
1. We can check you have received the payment from the insurer for each remittance statement.
2. We can spot payments missing remittances and request them from the insurer to ensure your invoices have been reconciled.

Effra even handles cases where remittances are made up of multiple payments, which is common with some insurers.
