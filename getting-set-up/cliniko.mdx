# Setting up Cliniko

To get Cliniko set up there are two steps:

1. [Granting Effra access to Cliniko](#granting-effra-access-to-cliniko)
2. [Setting up billable items](#setting-up-billable-items)

## Granting Effra access to Cliniko

1. From the left sidebar menu click **Settings**
2. Under **Our Clinic**, click on **Users & practitioners** then **Add user**
3. Enter a **First name** and **Last name** that will be clear for future reference for example **Effra** and **Ltd**
4. Enter [**robot@effra.io**](mailto:robot@effra.io) in the **Email** field
5. Select the **Power receptionist** as the security role
6. Select **No** under **Is this user a practitioner?**
7. Click **Create user** and enter your password to confirm
8. Click on the user you've just created to edit them. Then turn on **Allow Effra to create and update API keys**

Click **Update user** and enter your password to confirm

## Setting up billable items

In order to bill each invoice correctly, Effra needs to know which procedure and insurer it's for. To do this, you can edit your billable items in Cliniko.

This is also the Cliniko recommended way to manage insurance billing so you can ensure each session is priced correctly and you never accidentally underbill.

1. From the left sidebar menu click **Settings** then under **Finances** click on **Billable items**
2. Review your list of **Billable items**:
   1. The ideal format is **Insurer - Specialty - Consultation Type** for example **Bupa - Physiotherapy - Initial Assessment**
   2. The **item code** can be whatever is preferred for you
   3. Ensure you have one billing item for each type of procedure for each insurer. For example:
      1. **BUPA - Physiotherapy - Initial Assessment**
      2. **BUPA - Pelvic Floor - Follow Up**
      3. **AXA - Hydrotherapy - Initial Assessment**
   4. Ensure the billable item names have the insurer name in them as well as the name of the procedure
3. If you need to add any new billable item, click on the **Add service** or **Add other** button
