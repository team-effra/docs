title: "Patient payments"

We use Stripe to collect patient payments on your behalf, for example for excess payments.

We will send you specific instructions for how to set up a new Stripe account.

We cannot reuse existing Stripe accounts, you will need to create a new one.
This is so Effra can create invoices on your behalf and track payments.

Effra covers the Stripe fees and Stripe will pay you directly into your bank account.

Stripe will send invoices on your behalf to the patient so please register as the clinic rather than as an individual.
You can control the branding of the invoices Stripe sends [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding).
