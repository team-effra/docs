We will send you a form to complete with your provider and insurer registration details.

For each insurer, we will need the following details:
- Whether you submit as a clinic or as individual practitioners
- Your insurer registration number for each location or practitioner
- How you currently receive remittances

For each practitioner, we will need the following details:
- Their full name (as it appears on their insurer registration)
- Their specialty (physiotherapy, podiatry, osteopathy, etc.)
- Their professional registration number (GMC, HCPC, GOsC, etc.)

## Insurer portals

We access your insurer portals to submit claims and access your remittance statements.

We will send you specific instructions for each insurer portal.

### Supported insurer portals

- [Bupa Provider Online](./bupa-providers-online)
- WPA
- Healthcode

If the insurer does not have a portal we will provide you with a unique email address where you can send remittances.
