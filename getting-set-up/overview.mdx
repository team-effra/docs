2. [Connect Effra to your practice management system (PMS)](./practice-management-system) so we can import new invoices and add payments once they're paid.
3. [Set up a Stripe account](./patient-payments) so we can collect patient payments on your behalf, for example for excess payments.
4. [Connect your bank account](./bank-reconciliation) so we can reconcile insurer payments all the way through to your bank account (optional).
